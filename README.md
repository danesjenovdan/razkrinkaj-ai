# razkrinkaj-ai

### Development:

If you're developing with VSCode:
- Don't open the project folder directly. Instead open the provided [razkrinkaj-ai.code-workspace](./razkrinkaj-ai.code-workspace) file. This will setup the correct structure for formatting extensions and relative paths to work properly.
